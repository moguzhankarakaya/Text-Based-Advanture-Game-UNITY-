OPENING SCENE

WOKE UP! You did it again. Where are you?
Well...
Seems like in the middle of a forest. Dense trees are rising
above you clothing the sun rays coming at you. Yet you can see
tip of your nose. Where are you?

Do you remember how you ended up here? Don't think so. WOKE UP!
Look around you. You need to go somewhere. It might not be a good
idea to stay here after sun sets. Which way would you go?
